<h1>Graph Plotting Application</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a Graph Plotting Application with a graphical user interface built using Tkinter and Matplotlib. It is designed for users without programming experience to easily create and customize plots. The application supports five common chart types: line plot (plot), scatter plot (scatter), bar chart (bar), histogram (histogram), and pie chart (pie). The interface is divided into four sections: a chart selection menu for choosing chart type, adjusting settings, and managing the number of plots; a plot configuration panel for setting up each individual plot displayed in separate frames; a final figure settings panel for customizing axis labels, title, legend, grid, and generating the chart; and a status window that shows messages such as “Successfully built,” “Error in frame #X,” or “Maximum number of frames reached.”
